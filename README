Robots - version 2

This version has several features over the original version but is
still very much in the same spirit. Amongst the new features are

- Fast robots, these are robots that move at twice the speed of
	normal robots.
- Option settings in the style of rogue.
- movable scrap heaps.
- random & safe teleports with the ability to choose.
- antimatter

To build.
It should build on most sane systems,
You may want to play with some of the variables in Makefile, there
are a couple of version specific things to look for.
If you are on a BSD4.2 or better system add -DBSD42 to the CFLAGS
in the Makefile.
System 5 may need to remove -ltermcap from the LIBS line in Makefile.
Also if BSD42 is not defined, the score directory needs to be
writable to lock the files.
You may want to play with the location of the high score files which
are #defined near the begining of robots.h.

Type make, make install, and enjoy.
